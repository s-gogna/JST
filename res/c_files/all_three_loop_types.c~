                 * Then the _while_ loop runs, but with each of its iterations, a "do" is
                 * forced, so we see a _do-while_ iteration along with each _while_ iteration.
                 * Finally, the _for_ is allowed to progress without additional _while_ iterations.
                 * This is further discussed in the comments on each line
